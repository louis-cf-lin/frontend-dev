# Some Notes

- `+` is the unary operator. Fastest and best way to convert a string to a number
- `const` infers the assigned value itself as the type
- Object types contain key-type pairs
- 'Tuple' are **fixed-length**, **fixed-type** arrays
  - Define using `variable: [type, type, ...]`
  - `push()` is an exception to tuples
  - Offers stricter structure than array
- 'Enum' - automatically enumerated global constant identifiers
  - Use when wanting human-readable identifiers with mapped values
  - Assigns labels to values
  - Values can be anything, but increment automatically if not specified
- Capitalise custom types
- `void` vs `undefined`
  - `void` type when a function does not have a `return` statement
  - `undefined` type when a function has a `return` statement but returns nothing
  - Returning nothing and not having a `return` is the same thing in JavaScript but TypeScript makes a distinction
  - `void` is the standard and usually inferred
- `Function` types
  - Can pass a function as a parameter while simultaneously specifying the function's inputs and outputs
  - The parameter output can be `void` despite the passed function having an output (it just won't be used)
- `unknown` is like `any` but stricter
  - If you're not sure what a value might be but you know what you want to do with it eventually
  - It's a better choice than `any`
- `tsc -w` enters watch mode for all .tsc files
- Default `lib` items:
  - `dom`
  - `es6`
  - `dom.iterable`
  - `scripthost`
- `node_modules` is automatically excluded
